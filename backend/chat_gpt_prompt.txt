I am looking at a basketball scoreboard which contains 2 scores (one for each team), the current time, the current quarter, and shot clock. Using the following data, please give me the "file_path","score1", "score2", "time","quarter", "shot_clock" in a json with each video seperated. the data is over multiple seconds so please give me the largest time,score1,score2 and smallest shot_clock time. the quarter can only be 1,2,3,4 with overtime being set to 4. Please only return the json file, without any other text
